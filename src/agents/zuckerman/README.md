# Base Zuckerman Agent

This is the base zuckerman agent configuration. It serves as the reference implementation and template for creating custom agents.

**Important:** Keep this agent unedited to preserve the base configuration. When you need to customize behavior, create a new agent in a separate folder (e.g., `agents/my-custom-agent/`) and modify that instead.

This ensures you always have a clean reference point and can compare your customizations against the original.
